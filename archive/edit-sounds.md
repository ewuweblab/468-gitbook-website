### Sound Editing Tools

Here is a list of websites for editing, and optionally recording audio. If youâ€™re familiar with Adobe Audition or Premiere, feel free to use that also.

There are too many services to list. The criteria for the following services are:

* Free or free to try
* No logins required
* No software to install. Web based.

### MP3 Format

Conver to MP3 format. Why MP3 format?

* Generally smaller file sizes
* Widely (enough) supported across browsers
