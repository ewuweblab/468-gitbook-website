### Version Control via: GitHub (service & app)

Version Control is essential for modern web design, and development. Many version control options exist, _GitHub_ is the most widely used. The _GitHub Desktop_ app is the _graphical-user interface_ to the _GitHub_ service.

Create a GitHub account, and signup for the FREE Student Developer Pack.

### Build and Deploy with: _Netlify_

_GitHub_ is good for version control, but not website deployment, forms, CDNs, split testing, and edge networks. Many services like _Netlify_ exist, but it is the most widely used. [See GitHub vs. Netlify for more information.](https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/)

[Netlify: Develop & deploy the best web experiences in record time](https://www.netlify.com/)

### OPTIONAL Domain Name via: _Hover_

{% hint style="warning" %}
Optionally, at the end the Quarter if you'd like a custom domain name.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

[Hover](https://www.hover.com/) will be our domain name registrar. Create a [Hover.com](http://hover.com/) account and purchase a domain name. Take the time to find the best domain name options for yourself. Don’t rush it.

Note: Only [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) domains will be supported in Web Design 2. If you have a preexisting domain it cannot be used for course projects.

* Purchase a domain for **1-single-year**
* Turn on / Uncheck `auto renew` of domain
