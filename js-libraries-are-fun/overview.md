> JS Libraries are Fun.

## Why JS Libraries?&#x20;

JavaScript cannot - _and should not_ - have everything. Slowly (very slowly) it will become a standard in HTML and CSS. Libraries help push the web forward. E.g. [HTML dialog element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)

* Very quickly produce small proof of concept or larger rapid prototype
* Extend JavaScript's built-in functionality
* Pros: Write less code, do more, in less time.
* Cons: Files size, trust, bugs, performance, flexibility, etc.
* If possible, find libraries that do not have dependencies - from other libraries:
  * Other libraries e.g GSAP
  * Other frameworks e.g React
