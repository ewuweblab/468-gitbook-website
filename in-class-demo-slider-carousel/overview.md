### FAQ

* Why not just use a third-party _slide show_ JS library?
  * Too many JS to pick from libraries
    * Trust. Is the code is good, fast, & secure?
  * Extra dependency and added file size
* Can this be done with just CSS and **no** JS?
  * Yes, but pagination requires manual human counting
  * Yes, but limited to mouse interactions i.e. no keyboards, no swiping, etc.
