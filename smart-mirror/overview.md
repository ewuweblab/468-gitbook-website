# Overview

## Dashboard Widgets

> Same data. Different experience.

The concept of a _Dashboard_ appears nearly everywhere. Most obvious are car dashboards with displays of speed, mileage, and navigation. Less obvious examples are: the FaceBook banner with notifications, informational displays in lobbies, and “widgets” on iOS and Android. A portion of a larger display is a _widget_.

### Why Does This Exist?

* Application of [_Dashboard Design_ concepts](https://dataschool.com/how-to-design-a-dashboard/)
* APIs allows for alternative User Interfaces for same information
* Real products and real data, versus static prototypes
* Dashboards convey information in real-time — without prompting
* Apply concepts from Web Design 1 and 2 with APIs from Web 3

> Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design - Stephen Few, Author of _Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data_
