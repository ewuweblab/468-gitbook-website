# üíØ Project Challenges

Create a digital painting. Examples of digital "paintings" include screensavers, digital signage, wall Art, visualizations, etc. By using _code_, - and not a grapical user interface with a mouse - we can better understand the possibilities and limitations of any tool.

### Challenge: Requirements

* Painting can be static (still) or dynamic (animated)
* Minimum 500 pixel square. Feel free change.
* Created solely with the _Two.JS library_

### Challenge: Citations

* Find a pen, a website tutorial, or use in class examples
* Cite your sources where any code is borrowed
